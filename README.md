# **ST-Sim**

**ST-Sim** is an open-source [SyncroSim](http://www.syncrosim.com) base package that lets you develop and run spatially-explicit, stochastic [state-and-transition simulation models](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12597) of landscape change. Both **ST-Sim** and SyncroSim have been designed and developed by [ApexRMS](http://www.apexrms.com).
