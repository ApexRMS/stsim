ST-Sim is a [SyncroSim](http://www.syncrosim.com) Package that lets you develop and run spatially-explicit, stochastic state-and-transition simulation models [(STSMs)](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12597) of landscape change.  Both ST-Sim and SyncroSim have been designed and developed by [ApexRMS](http://www.apexrms.com).
